# Cashier System Test Cases

This outlines a comprehensive set of test cases for a cashier system. These test cases are intended to ensure the system correctly calculates prices, applies appropriate discounts, and handles various scenarios including individual product purchases, combinations, and edge cases.

## ðŸ’­ Assumptions
While making these test cases, the following assumptions were made:

1. **There are three products:** Green Tea, Strawberries, and Coffee.
2. **There are three types of rules:** Free, Reduced Price, and Fraction Price. Rules are defined in the table below.

## ðŸš€ Test Structure
The test cases are structured to cover boundary conditions and use equivalence partitioning. This approach ensures we validate that:

1. The expected rule is applied correctly for each scenario.
2. The total price calculation is accurate.

I've organized the tests in tables because they're easier to read and compare. Each table covers a specific product or scenario, with columns for the test case ID, items added, original price, rule applied, and expected price. This format makes it simple to:

1. Quickly scan different scenarios.
2. Understand the logic behind each test case.
3. Verify that all discount rules are tested.
4. Ensure we're covering edge cases and combinations.

By structuring the tests this way, we can efficiently cover a wide range of scenarios without redundancy, giving us confidence in the system's accuracy and reliability.
